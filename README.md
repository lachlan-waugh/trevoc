# trevoc
A kernel-land rootkit for Linux

## stealth
* hides it's files/directories
* hides processes/their trees
* hides network connections/activity
* prevents basic detections by tooling
* cleans system logs

### hooking


## persistence
* crontab? perhaps
* setuid binary

## acknowledgement
heavily inspired from many of the rootkits from [awesome linux rootkits](https://github.com/milabs/awesome-linux-rootkits)
